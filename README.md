Hello , my friends .Thank you for you to visit my github. This is my first time to create and commit code to github .There must a lots of
mistakes and something wrong .The reason is that i can not totally understand Github.com .There are too much new concepts,such as commit ,pull 
request,fork,repository ,default branch and so on .
